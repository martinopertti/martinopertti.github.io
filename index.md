Welcome! My Name is Martín Opertti and I am a Political Science PhD Student at Duke university. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant and Instructor at the <a href="https://umad.cienciassociales.edu.uy/">Methods and Data Access Unit</a> (FCS-UdelaR) and as a data scientist at <a href="https://verasight.io/">Verasight</a>. My work appears in publications such as Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties and the Revista Latinoamericana de Opinión Pública and I am co-author of the book <a href="https://twittarquia.weebly.com/">Twittarquia, la política de las redes en Uruguay</a>. </div>  <br>

My main research interests are mass political behavior and quantitative methods. In particular, I study the origins and consequences of party identifications, how citizens react to political information, affective polarization and social media and politics (i.e. echo chambers, online political incivility). I am also interested in social network analysis, survey methodology, data visualization and programming in R. </div> <br>
